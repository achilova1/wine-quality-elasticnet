# wine-quality-elasticnet
This project aims to predict the quality of wine using chemical properties from the [Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we implement **ElasticNet Regression**, a linear model that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.
